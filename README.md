## Description 

I created a real estate app that allows prospective buyers, sellers, and investors to search information filtered by price, location, square footage, architecture design, number of bedrooms or bathrooms, etc. Users will have the ability to manage listings by adding new properties or subdivisions, tracking availability, deleting inactive listings, and changing higher or lower listing prices.  I always have interest in the Real Estate business, it is a market that will keep growing and as an aspiring Web Developer, I wanted to help users find their perfect home with a tool that is effective and user-friendly.
